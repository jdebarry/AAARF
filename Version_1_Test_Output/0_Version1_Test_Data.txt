This is not a substitute for reading the AAARF README file.
This folder contains test data for running AAARF.
This should not be used to help interpret biological significance of experimental AAARF runs.  Its sole purpose is to verify that AAARF is installed properly and able to run.

Usage:  perl AAARFv1.pl ZU_1000.fasta

Input Files (These files must be in the same directory before running AAARF):
ZU_1000.fasta - main input file with sample sequences to be assembled into high-copy number repeats
formatdb_log - log file generated when ZU_1000.fasta is formatted for BLAST searching
ZU_1000.fasta.nhr - BLAST database file generated when ZU_1000.fasta is formatted for BLAST searching
ZU_1000.fasta.nin - BLAST database file generated when ZU_1000.fasta is formatted for BLAST searching
ZU_1000.fasta.nsq - BLAST database file generated when ZU_1000.fasta is formatted for BLAST searching

Output Files:
ZU_1000_AAARF.fasta - main output file with pseudomolecule assemblies of high-copy number repeats
AAARF_log - detailed log of all AAARF activities formatted based on log4Perl perl module
bl2seq_out - temporary file that contains last bl2seq output (can be ignored)
clustalw_out - temporary file that contains last clustalw output (can be ignored)
